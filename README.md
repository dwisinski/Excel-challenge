## Project: Excel Homework - Excel Data Analysis

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of data analysis and graphing/presentation concepts in Excel on an actual set of historical Kickstarter campaign data. Concepts covered include: basic statistical formulas, conditional formatting, Pivot Tables, graphs and charts, basic data visualization, etc.

## Notes:
This data set was used to demonstrate basic Excel skills and functionality; more meaningful analysis would require a richer data set.
